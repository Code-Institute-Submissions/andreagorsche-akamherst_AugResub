                <em>‘A story of staying true to yourself, of building relationships, of bridging differences across a

                <em>‘This book is absolutely fantastic … Firstly, I want to comment on how well researched Belfast
                    Central is … I studied history and Irish politics in university, and I am Irish, so I have a fair

        <h1 class="subh1">Books</h1>
        <p id="teaser">Ryan turned his back on his familys' enterprise in the ammunitions industry to become a
            paramedic. When he gets shot and almost dies on duty he struggles to stay true to his morals.</p>
        <h2>About Belfast Central</h2>
        <p>Belfast 1993: A nocturnal ambulance service at the Belfast Central Station almost turns deadly for the young
            paramedic Ryan. In the crosshairs of the IRA, he is badly wounded and wakes up in the hospital with muddled
            memories. The police close the case fast, leaving too many burning questions unanswered. Most importantly,
            who was that old man who appeared at the scene out of nowhere and saved Ryan’s life? Not fully recovered
            yet, Ryan begins searching for the mysterious man, only to get dragged into a feud between opposing
            paramilitaries – with fatal consequences… </p>
        <h2>How did it come about?</h2>
        <p>I like to refer to my first book as “The Book” because it will (hopefully) never take me that long again to
            finish a novel. How clueless I was, when I started writing the first lines 12 years ago – lines that didn’t
            survive. But the main character did, and with each draft, he became stronger and more authentic. As far as I
            am concerned, he is of flesh and blood now; that’s how much time I gave him to develop.
            <p>What also stayed the same throughout this painful experience was the topic. Ever since I read the Joan
                Lingard’s Kevin and Sadie series. I wanted to write about the Northern Ireland Conflict. The question
                that
                drove me was: How come Ireland became independent from Great Britain in 1921, but the Troubles broke out
                in
                1969 – almost 50 years later? Despite extensive research I consider myself everything but an expert on
                the
                topic. But I can fairly say that Belfast Central is an authentic novel that considered historic events
                without falling into clichés.</p>
            <h2>The fate of the unfinished</h2>
            <p>Many manuscripts end up in a desk drawer, unfinished and soon forgotten about. With Belfast Central being
                my
                first try, it could have gone that way, but the story and the characters were too important to be put
                aside.
                I stayed true to them and pulled through a lot of drafts and rewriting. The characters of Belfast
                Central
                were worth the effort. And I am sure reading about them will be as thrilling as telling their story was
                for
                me.
                So, enjoy and keep reading! <br>
