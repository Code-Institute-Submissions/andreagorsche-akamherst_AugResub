## Credits

### Code

1. The idea to set the box-model elements to zero/none in the css stylesheet came from the Love Running example.

## Style

1. Font choice: The wireframe worked with the heading font Chalkduster. Since this font was not available by Google fonts, Frederika the Great was suggested by Graphichow (https://graphichow.com/knowledge/what-is-a-chalkboard-font-2/). Thus, this font was chosen as a heading font. Since Google Fonts doesn't the pairing feature anymore the developer googled for pairing fonts and found the recommendation to use Oswald. This recommendation was given by Easil (https://about.easil.com/free-font-pairing-guide-templates/)
