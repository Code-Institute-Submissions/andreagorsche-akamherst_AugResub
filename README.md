## Technologies

### Languages Used

HTML
CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. Google Fonts: Google Fonts was used to import the two fonts "Fredericka the Great" and "Oswald" into the css stylesheet. The fonts are on all pages of this project.
2. Font Awesome: Font Awesome was used to import icons for the social media links in the footer.

## Credits



### Code

1. The idea to set the box-model elements to zero/none in the css stylesheet came from the Love Running project.
2. Also the idea of doing the menu as an unordered list was taken from the Love Running project.
3. My mentor introduced me to the CSS command flex which opened completely new doors regarding my front page.

## Style

1. Font choice: The wireframe worked with the heading font Chalkduster. Since this font was not available by Google fonts, Frederika the Great was suggested by Graphichow (https://graphichow.com/knowledge/what-is-a-chalkboard-font-2/). Thus, this font was chosen as a heading font. Since Google Fonts doesn't the pairing feature anymore the developer googled for pairing fonts and found the recommendation to use Oswald. This recommendation was given by Easil (https://about.easil.com/free-font-pairing-guide-templates/)

2. In order to align with the split screen of the front page, I decided to layout the subpages in a horizontal 50/50 ratio.
3. Since the front page already displayed the main navigation, me and my mentor decided that a navigation bar at the top would be repetitive. Still, we decided to add a header and footer for consistency.
4. The main goal of the design was to keep it simple and guarantee that the user has a good overview of the divers content (audio, video, extracts, texts ...) at all times.

### Content

The content of the website was created by the developer who happens to be the writer A.K. Amherst.

### Media

The media used on this website was either produced by the developer and author herself or bought for commercial use (e.g. the footage of the book trailer). While the reading extract was layouted by the graphic designer Grit Bomhauer, the press portfolio was designed by A.K. Amherst aka Andrea Gorsche herself.

## Testing
Through out the process of coding the website and its functionalities were tested. The Dev Tools were used for debugging and responsive design decisions.
The main issue while coding this page was indeed the front page with the four tiles at its center. I tried around a lot with the float command before being introduced to the flex command by my mentor. In both cases the main challenge was to align the picture tiles and the text captions on top in the same manner.
Through research on the net I am aware that such features are far easier to implement with JavaScript. Still, flex is a very good method to go what I aimed to do: visualize the pages content in a 4-split-screen.
Another issue I faced during coding was the footer. I imagined to have the 3 social media icons with a decent padding on the left, the email contact in the middle and the copright text on the right. I also wanted to solve this with flex, after being introduced to it. But each time I tried to align the elements, the 3 icons were squeezed together. This could be solved by introducing 3 divs in the footer.
Although, I am aware that the header could be done with flex as well - I even had it in one of the early coding version, I felt like using another approach to train multiple different commands in CSS and HTML and not get to fixed on flex alone.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to my mentor who believed in me and this project. His advice and tips were precious and I learned a lot.

Also thanks to the great teachers at Code Institute and the amazing tutors. I only needed a tutor session once when setting up and navigating around Gitpod for the first time. The support was friendly, fast and reliable.
