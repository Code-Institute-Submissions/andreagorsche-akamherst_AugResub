## Technologies

### Languages Used

HTML
CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. Google Fonts: Google Fonts was used to import the two fonts "Fredericka the Great" and "Oswald" into the css stylesheet. The fonts are on all pages of this project.
2. Font Awesome: Font Awesome was used to import icons for the social media links in the footer.

## Credits

### Code

1. The following ideas came from the Love Running Project:
    a) setting box-model elements to zero/none in the css stylesheet.

    b) doing the menu as an unordered list

    c) how to create responsiveness for the header.
2. My mentor introduced me to the CSS command flex which opened completely new doors regarding my front page and many other elements in the code.

## Style

1. Font choice: The wireframe worked with the heading font Chalkduster. Since this font was not available by Google fonts, Frederika the Great was suggested by Graphichow (https://graphichow.com/knowledge/what-is-a-chalkboard-font-2/). Thus, this font was chosen as a heading font. Since Google Fonts doesn't the pairing feature anymore the developer googled for pairing fonts and found the recommendation to use Oswald. This recommendation was given by Easil (https://about.easil.com/free-font-pairing-guide-templates/)

2. There are four different designs. 
    a) the title page
    b) the subpages main design (about, seo writing, books)
    c) the short stories design (choice of articles menu)
    d) the reading pages of short stories
3. Since the front page already displayed the main navigation, me and my mentor decided that a navigation bar at the top would be repetitive. Still, we decided to add a header and footer for consistency.
4. The main goal of the design was to keep it simple and guarantee that the user has a good overview of the divers content (audio, video, extracts, texts ...) at all times.

### Content

The content of the website was created by me, the developer and writer behind A.K. Amherst.

### Media

The media used on this website was either produced by me or bought for commercial use (e.g. the footage of the book trailer). While the reading extract was layouted by the graphic designer Grit Bomhauer, the press portfolio was designed by me.

## Testing
### TitlePage

Through out the process of coding the website and its functionalities were tested. The Dev Tools were used for debugging and responsive design decisions.
The main issue while coding this page was indeed the front page with the four tiles at its center. I tried a lot with the float command before being introduced to the flex command by my mentor. In both cases the main challenge was to align the picture tiles and the text captions on top in the same position.
Through research on the net I am aware that such features are far easier to implement with JavaScript. Still, flex is a very good method to go what I aimed to do: visualize the pages content in a 4-split-screen.

### Footer
Another issue I faced during coding was the footer. I imagined to have the 3 social media icons with a decent padding on the left, the email contact in the middle and the copright text on the right. I also wanted to solve this with flex, after being introduced to it. But each time I tried to align the elements, the 3 social media icons were squeezed together. This could be solved by introducing 3 divs in the footer.

### Header
Although, I am aware that the header could be done with flex as well - I even had it in one of the early coding version, I felt like using another approach to train multiple different commands in CSS and HTML and not get to fixed on flex alone.

### Lessons Learned
Through trial and error I managed to program the website I wanted. The main lessons learned were:
1) the level of divs used is very important
2) being careful what I target - sometimes I targeted the div instead of the e.g. h2 inside and wondered why the CSS command was not working.
3) I learned a lot about responsive design 

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to my mentor who believed in me and this project. His advice and tips were precious and I learned a lot. 

Also thanks to the great teachers at Code Institute and the amazing tutors. The one time I needed a tutor - when first setting up Gitpod - the support was friendly, fast and reliable.
