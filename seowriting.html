         <h2>Why you should hire me?</h2>
    <p>"Content drives action, otherwise it's poetry" - Carsten Rossi.
        Every campaign, every newsletter, every PR text or blog article should not only reach the customer but also tell a story. The story of your enterprise, your product/service and its uniqueness. Text is more than just a cluster of words - text, written well, is capable of transporting a message. Love helping you with that.
