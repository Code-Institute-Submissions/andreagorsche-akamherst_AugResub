            <h2>Short Story Quotes</h2>
            <p class="quote">“My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I
                have left. I remember exactly where I set down each and every one of them, and how I felt when I did.
                Short stories are like guideposts to my heart ...”
                <br>― Haruki Murakami</p>
            <p class="quote">“A short story must have a single mood and every sentence must build towards it.” <br>
                ― Edgar Allan Poe
            </p>
            <p class="quote">““Write a short story every week. It's not possible to write 52 bad short stories in a
                row.”<br>
                ― Ray Bradbury

        <p>He is still breathing as we lift him out of the trunk and throw him into the river. He was one of the most
            scary men of London. He was my idol. Everything I know about murder, I learned from him. Learnings I want to
            pass on to Hendrik now.
            Hendrik – so young and strong. He is able to break once neck like a toothpick.  One day, when I grow weak,
            when I start to feel pity for my victims, Hendrik will redeem me. Just as I redeem the man that is now
            sinking to the bottom of this river.
            The End</p>

    <h1>Running Sushi</h1>
    <h2>published 2016</h2>
    <article class="short">
        <p>The moving food in front calms me in a weird way. I feel like the food will never stop coming around, no
            matter how much time I take to enjoy it. I start with a tiny plate of spring rolls, dip them in soy sauce.
            Mhm! I let Sushis and Makis pass and snatch the plates with fried duck – my favorite. Unfortunetley the
            amount of plates serving duck are very limited compared to other meals.
            There is a small message between the pieces of duck meat on the next plate.
            Aren’t you scared of getting webs between your toes?
            A grinning smiley next to the message leaves no doubt it is meant as a joke.</p>

    <h1>Beloved Paul</h1>
    <h2>published with Elbverlag, 2013</h2>
    <h3>special topic: Love</h3>
    <article class="short">
        <p>Paul is part of our family. He sits with us at the table, goes to bed with the kids at night and he even has
            his own toothbrush. He was there when we celebrated Norbert’s promotion, when our Marie was born and when I
            found out that my father was going to die.
            Four years ago, at the fun fair we met Paul for the first time. In one of those booths he sat on a shelf,
            squeezed between two Teddys that were much bigger than him.
            „That one, I want that one“, Max had said.</p>
