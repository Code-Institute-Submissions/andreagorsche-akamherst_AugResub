    <h1>Beloved Paul</h1>

    <article class="short">
        <p>Paul is part of our family. He sits with us at the table, goes to bed with the kids at night and he even has
            his own toothbrush. He was there when we celebrated Norbert’s promotion, when our Marie was born and when I
            found out that my father was going to die.
            Four years ago, at the fun fair we met Paul for the first time. In one of those booths he sat on a shelf,
            squeezed between two Teddys that were much bigger than him.
            „That one, I want that one“, Max had said.</p>
